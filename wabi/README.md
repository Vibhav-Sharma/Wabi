# wabi

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Project structure (added)

The `lib/` folder now includes an initial scaffold for the app:

- `app.dart`, `main.dart` — app entry & wiring
- `core/` — app-wide utilities, models, and theme
- `data/` — data access layer and services
- `features/` — feature directories (search, player, playlists)
- `widgets/` — shared UI widgets

This is a minimal scaffold to get started; implement features and hook services as needed.
